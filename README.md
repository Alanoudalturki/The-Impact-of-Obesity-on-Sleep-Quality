# The Impact of Obesity on Sleep Quality

## Overview

This project investigates the relationship between obesity and sleep quality using structured survey data. The goal is to determine whether higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with poorer sleep outcomes. The analysis combines descriptive statistics, bivariate comparisons, and multivariable regression to provide a comprehensive view of how obesity may influence sleep quality.

## Type of Analysis

**Descriptive, Bivariate, and Multivariable Analysis**

- **Descriptive Analysis**: Summarized sleep quality scores and BMI distributions across demographic subgroups.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Used t-tests and ANOVA to compare sleep quality across different BMI categories.
- **Multivariable Analysis**: Applied linear regression to control for potential confounders (e.g., age, gender) and assess the independent effect of BMI on sleep quality.

## Objectives

- Describe patterns of sleep quality across BMI groups  
- Test whether obesity is significantly associated with poorer sleep  
- Adjust for demographic covariates using multivariable analysis  
- Visualize relationships to support public health insights

## Dataset

- Source: Survey-based dataset with self-reported sleep quality and health indicators  
- Key variables:
  - Body Mass Index (BMI)
  - Global Sleep Quality Score (e.g., PSQI)
  - Demographics: age, gender, etc.

## Key Findings

- Descriptive statistics show lower average sleep quality among obese individuals  
- Bivariate tests (ANOVA) confirmed significant differences in sleep quality by BMI category  
- Multivariable regression indicated that higher BMI remained a significant predictor of poor sleep even after adjusting for age and gender

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- SciPy, statsmodels (for statistical testing and regression)

## Skills Demonstrated

- Descriptive and comparative analysis in health data  
- Inferential statistics (t-tests, ANOVA, regression modeling)  
- Health informatics research design  
- Data storytelling with visualizations
